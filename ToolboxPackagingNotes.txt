Toolbox Packaging Instructions

0. Ensure the Apps Packaging Project is up-to-date. This should only
   include the entry-point function (the app launcher), so create/update
   the Apps Packaging Project whilst the rest of the toolbox code is off
   the path (e.g., close the project first).

   Ensure all labels and published HTML examples are up-to-date, using the
   project shortcuts for automation.

   Ensure Contents.m is up-to-date.

1. With the project open, select Project --> Share --> Toolbox.

2. Do not use the project root as the top-level folder. Use the
   subfolder tbx. This is the toolbox "root directory".

3. Since the project is open, the path should be correct in the
   toolbox packaging configuration file.

4. Examples will be published to HTML separately for File Exchange.
