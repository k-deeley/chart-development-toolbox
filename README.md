# Chart Development Toolbox

[![View <Chart Development Toolbox> on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/65857-chart-development-toolbox)  

This toolbox contains the MATLABÂ® code for the technical article [Creating Specialized Charts with MATLAB Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/creating-specialized-charts-with-matlab-object-oriented-programming.html).

A chart provides a task-specific application programming interface (API) for creating custom visualizations. Designing and implementing a chart not only provides a convenient API for end users, but simultaneously removes the need for the user to manipulate low-level graphics objects.

The toolbox comprises several diverse examples of custom MATLAB charts, together with a catalog app for browsing the available charts.

You can inspect the source code used for each chart, explore the features and functionality of each chart, and run Live Script examples demonstrating the use of each chart. The toolbox also has documentation and resources to help you get started with developing your own charts.
